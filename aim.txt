‚îú‚îÄ utils/         # Preprocessing scripts (PDF/DOCX extraction)
‚îú‚îÄ docs/          # Sample legal documents
‚îú‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ README.md


Initialize Python virtual environment (venv or conda)

Python: pip install streamlit fastapi uvicorn PyMuPDF pdfplumber openai faiss-cpu

Optional: pip install tesseract pytesseract for scanned PDFs

Create README.md with basic description:

Project name

Objective: ‚ÄúTurn complex legal documents into plain-English summaries + risk alerts‚Äù

Team members

Deliverable: GitHub repo initialized with folders, virtual environment, and README.

Task 2: Collect Sample Documents

Objective: Gather documents for MVP testing.

Steps:

Collect 5‚Äì10 templates for each:

Rental agreements

Loan contracts

Terms of Service

Optional for stretch: NDAs, employment contracts

Save in /docs folder with clear naming:
rental_1.pdf, loan_1.pdf, tos_1.pdf

Ensure documents have enough clauses to test summaries and risks

Deliverable: A set of sample documents ready for preprocessing.

Phase 2: Document Processing
Task 3: Text Extraction

Objective: Convert documents into plain text for AI analysis.

Steps:

Use PyMuPDF / PDFPlumber to extract text from PDF

For scanned PDFs, use Tesseract OCR

Remove unnecessary content:

Headers / footers

Page numbers

Signatures / irrelevant lines

Save each document as clean text file in /docs/processed/

Deliverable: Each document has a clean, readable text version.

Task 4: Clause Splitting

Objective: Break documents into clauses for analysis.

Steps:

Detect clause boundaries:

Usually numbered: ‚Äú1.‚Äù ‚Äú2.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ or section headings

Or split by paragraph breaks if no numbering

Optional: Tag clauses manually for testing:

Payment, Termination, Liability, Data Sharing, Auto-renewal
