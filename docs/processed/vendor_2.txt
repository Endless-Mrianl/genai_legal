with respect to such intellectual property created for Pace in accordance with this
Agreement shall be registered in the name of Pace University. If the Work is

date of this Agreement or the creation of any of the intellectual property, whichever is
earlier, Vendor irrevocably transfers and assigns to Pace the entire right, title, and
interest, including, but not limited to, copyright, in and to the intellectual property, in
whole or in part, together with all extensions of such copyrights, that may be secured
under the Copyright Act or under any other copyright law or similar law in effect in
the United States or in any other countries or under any treaties, conventions, or
proclamations. Vendor agrees to execute and deliver to Pace any documents that may
be necessary to effectuate the transfer and assignment of the intellectual property
rights in the Work contemplated by this Agreement and to do such other acts and
things as may be reasonably requested by Pace to perfect or evidence such transfer.
Vendor shall have no ownership or copyright in Pace materials, nor in the intellectual

any other form. [USE THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE ONLY FOR CONTRACTS
WITH PROVIDERS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHO ARE BASED
OUTSIDE THE U.S.: Vendor hereby waives any moral rights of any kind in the
Work and the intellectual property.] Pace shall have no rights in any of Vendor’s
intellectual property that is not developed specially for Pace pursuant to this
Agreement.
14. Indemnification. Vendor agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Pace
University, its successors and assigns, and their respective trustees, officers,
employees, and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent permitted by
law from and against any and all claims or demands whatsoever, including, but not
limited to, associated costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred on
account thereof (“Claims”) asserted against Pace as a result of Vendor’s work or
performance or non-performance of this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
Claims that may be asserted by any person(s), including, but not limited to,
Consultant’s employees and employees of Vendor’s subcontractors or agents
(“Claimants”), for loss, damage, death, injury, sexual harassment, or molestation to or
of persons or property; or, where applicable, infringement of any third-party
intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, those of copyright; or, where
applicable, unauthorized release of or failure to protect confidential information of all
types, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information (PII) or
electronic protected health information (ePHI) (“Losses”) arising in any manner out
of or incident to Vendor’s performance or nonperformance hereunder.
15. Cooperation. The parties agree to cooperate with each other in connection with
any internal investigations by Pace or Vendor of possible violation of their respective
policies and procedures and any third party litigation, except that Pace shall not be
required to have any contact with any Union or Union representatives of Vendor’s
employees or subcontractors or participate in any Union grievance or other
proceedings relative to Vendor’s employees or subcontractors except as a fact
witness.
16. Insurance. Vendor shall at all times during the term of this agreement carry, and
require its subcontractors to carry, at least the following types and amounts of
insurance:
 Workers Compensation insurance on all employees, whether paid or
volunteer, as may be required by applicable state law. If Vendor is
exempt under appropriate state law from the requirement to carry workers
compensation insurance, Vendor must submit a written statement to that
effect in a form satisfactory to Pace;
 Commercial General Liability with limits of not less than $1,000,000 each
occurrence, $1 million products and completed operations aggregate, and
$2 million general aggregate. Such insurance shall include coverage for
claims arising from all activities and work to be performed by Vendor;
 If vehicles will be used in the performance of the work, Commercial
Automobile Liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000
combined single limit each accident covering all owned and non-owned
vehicles;
 If professional services, or any other services, requiring a license are to be
performed by Vendor, Professional Liability (Malpractice) insurance with
limits of not less than $1 million each accident or occurrence covering
claims arising from the professional service being performed.
 Pace shall be named as additional insured on all of camp’s liability
insurance policies, and the camp’s policies shall be primary coverage for
Pace, regardless of whatever other insurance Pace may have available.
Such policies of insurance shall be maintained with insurance companies authorized
to do business in the State of New York and provide that they may not be canceled or
materially changed except upon 30 days prior written notice to Pace. Vendor shall, at
the time of the execution of this Agreement, furnish Pace with a certificate of
insurance evidencing such coverage, and naming Pace as an additional insured with
respect to its liability coverages. It is the intent of the parties that Vendor’s insurance
be primary and non-contributory coverage for Pace for claims arising from Vendor’s
performance of this contract, regardless of whatever other insurance Pace may have
available. The insurance required pursuant to this Section 16 shall not be deemed to
limit Vendor’s obligations to indemnify Pace under this Agreement.
[ADD THE FOLLOWING TEXT TO INSURANCE PARAGRAPH FOR
RESTAURANT AND CATERING CONTRACTS WHERE ALCOHOL MAY BE
SERVED: Vendor’s liability insurance shall include coverage for Dram Shop
liability or similar liability imposed by law. Vendor shall furnish a certificate from its
insurance carrier showing that it has complied with the foregoing provisions, and
providing that the said insurance policies will not be changed or canceled during their
term until after at least thirty (30) days prior written notice by registered mail to Pace.
If the required certificate of insurance is not provided to Pace in advance of the event,
Pace shall have the right to terminate and receive a full refund of any amounts paid in
advance.]
17. Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Agreement, Pace shall not be liable, nor shall any credit or other remedy be extended,
for Pace’s failure, in whole or in part, to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement
where such failure arises from or in connection with causes beyond Pace’s control,
including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, extreme weather, fire or other natural
calamity, terrorist attack, any law, order, or regulation or action of any governmental
entity or civil or military authority, power or utility failure, cable cuts, unavailability
of rights-of-way, national emergencies, riots, wars, strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages,
or other labor difficulties (each a “Force Majeure Event”). If a Force Majeure Event
occurs during the term hereof, Pace shall be excused from performance hereunder.

this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to its choice of law principles. Litigation of all disputes between the parties
arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be conducted in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction in the State of New York, County of New York.
