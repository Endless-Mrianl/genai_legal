Pace, regardless of whatever other insurance Pace may have available.
Such policies of insurance shall be maintained with insurance companies authorized
to do business in the State of New York and provide that they may not be canceled or
materially changed except upon 30 days prior written notice to Pace. Vendor shall, at
the time of the execution of this Agreement, furnish Pace with a certificate of
insurance evidencing such coverage, and naming Pace as an additional insured with
respect to its liability coverages. It is the intent of the parties that Vendor’s insurance
be primary and non-contributory coverage for Pace for claims arising from Vendor’s
performance of this contract, regardless of whatever other insurance Pace may have
available. The insurance required pursuant to this Section 16 shall not be deemed to
limit Vendor’s obligations to indemnify Pace under this Agreement.
