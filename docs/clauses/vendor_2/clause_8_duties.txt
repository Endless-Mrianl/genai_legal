onfidentiality. During the course of performance of the Agreement, Vendor
may be given access to information that relates to Pace’s past, present and future
research, development, business activities, products, services, technical knowledge,
and personally identifiable student and employee information, or protected health
information (“PHI”)/electronic protected health information (“ePHI”). All such
information shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information” unless otherwise
indicated by Pace in writing at or after the time of disclosure. Vendor may use the
Confidential Information only in connection with the specific duties authorized
pursuant to this Agreement. Access to the Confidential Information shall be restricted
to those of Vendor’s personnel, representatives and consultants on a need-to-know
basis solely in connection with Vendor’s internal business. Vendor further agrees that
it shall (i) take all necessary steps to inform any of its personnel, representatives or
consultants to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed of Vendor’s
obligations hereunder and (ii) cause said personnel, representatives and consultants to
agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement by executing a confidentiality
agreement containing the same restrictions contained herein or some other method
acceptable to Pace. Vendor agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own
proprietary and confidential information of like kind, but in no event less than
reasonable means. Vendor agrees to notify Pace of any unauthorized use or
disclosure of Confidential Information and to take all actions reasonably necessary to
prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure thereof. These requirements apply to
any subcontractors or agents Vendor uses in the performance of the Work and it is
Vendor’s responsibility to assure that all such subcontractors and agents comply with
all such requirements. The terms of this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.
