Having a good start to an employment relationship and making a positive first impression on a new hire
is essential to establishing a productive, successful, and professional workplace. An important part of
this process is creating an employment agreement. There are many advantages to having a well-crafted
employment agreement, the most obvious of which is the legal protection it affords a company or
business. By providing written employment terms—including details of compensation, position, and at-will
status — the company is creating a legal document that, when signed, can prove valuable if disputes occur.
A written agreement lists employment terms, limiting later confusion and disagreement about those
provisions. An express statement of terms not only eliminates ambiguities, but also establishes a
working relationship built on mutual understanding.
This document contains employment agreement essentials, including a standard form that can easily be
revised and used again for the hiring of future employees. If you follow the guidelines provided, you can use
your employment agreement effectively to protect your business and minimize confusion, misunderstanding,
and error. In every way, this promotes a successful work environment and satisfied employees.
