os & Don’ts Checklist
A good employment agreement is one that captures the intentions of the parties accurately.
It’s a good idea to clarify the potential employee’s job duties and responsibilities, and his or her
compensation package, before writing them down.
Historically, only executives and professionals received employment agreements. It was
fairly unusual for lower managers or workers to negotiate and sign such contracts. However,
employment agreements have more recently been used for all new hires at a company. Entering
into contracts with all of your employees may offer long-term protection to both parties.
Do not promise raises, bonuses, or other business perks if those are not guaranteed. Do not include
anything that is not an absolute. Many lawsuits are predicated on misunderstandings related to
expected bonuses. If you have a simple bonus calculation applicable to this employee, include that
information in the agreement.
If the company will reimburse or provide funds for moving expenses, include that information here
and make your language precise.
Regardless of the nature of your arrangement, the employment agreement should be signed before
the employee starts work.
If you revise the enclosed agreement, do not alter the at-will language or insert terms that would
conflict with that language (for example, references to long-term employment). Nothing in this form
or any other writing should contradict your arrangement for at-will employment. Many wrongful
termination cases have been launched on the employee’s mistaken assumption that his or her
employment was for a guaranteed length of time or that they could not be terminated without cause.

A non-disclosure clause in which the employee agrees to keep the company’s private information
private that is effective from the beginning of the employment can protect a company more
thoroughly than one entered at the end of the relationship. A departing employee’s ability to use
confidential information will continue to be effective, and you will not need to negotiate with a
potentially hostile party to ensure this limitation.
If you do include a clause that puts limits on a departing employee’s ability to compete with the
company, make sure the scope and reach of this clause is reasonable. Although some states’
courts enforce these clauses as a matter of course, many others (including California) view them
unfavorably and will not enforce them unless the restrictions are very narrow. There must be
a correlation between the time period for the limitation and the need for the clause. In other
words, this clause can only be for as long it would take for an employer to overcome any potential
competitive disadvantage.
If you want a specific state’s laws to resolve any employment disputes, specify that state in the
employment agreement. Courts will generally honor the parties’ choice of law if the state selected
has a connection to the dispute.
The provisions of an employment agreement will bind your employee strictly only if you follow them
to the letter. In other words, you can enforce its terms against your employee if you do not violate
your own obligations under the agreement. For example, your employee will not be bound by the
terms of a non-competition clause if you try to end the agreement without giving the required notice.
Nothing lasts forever, and this is certainly true of employment. At the end of an employment
relationship, your company should conduct an exit interview, and you should consider putting
this as a requirement in his or her employment agreement. At this meeting, the employee
should be reminded of his or her continuing obligations to the company, including maintaining
the confidentiality of information beyond the termination of the employment period. You can also
use this time to resolve misunderstandings and smooth ruffled feathers, perhaps limiting later
termination-related lawsuits.
Allow the employee to spend time reviewing the agreement. This will reduce the likelihood, or at
least the efficacy, of a claim that he or she did not understand any terms or how those might affect
the agreement as a whole.
Both parties should review the completed document carefully to ensure that all relevant points
have been included. It is better to be over-inclusive than under-inclusive. Do not assume that certain
expectations or terms are agreed to if they are not stated expressly in the document.
Sign two copies of the agreement, one each for you and the other party.
If your agreement is complicated, do not use the enclosed form. Contact an attorney to help you
draft a document that will meet your specific needs.
