contractors under any of the following circumstances:
1. with Tenant’s consent;
2. in case of emergency;
3. when Tenant unreasonably withholds consent; or
4. if Tenant is absent from the Premises for a period of at least one-half a Rental Installment Period. (If the rent is
current and Tenant notifies the Landlord of an intended absence, then Landlord may enter only with Tenant’s
consent for the protection or preservation of the Premises.
XII. PROHIBITED ACTS BY LANDLORD.
Landlord cannot cause, directly or indirectly, the termination or unreasonable interruption of any utility service
furnished to Tenant, including, but not limited to, water, heat, light, electricity, gas, elevator, garbage collection, or
refrigeration (whether or not the utility service is under the control of, or payment is made by, Landlord).
Landlord cannot prevent Tenant’s access to the Premises by any means, including, but not limited to, changing the
locks or using any bootlock or similar device.
Landlord cannot remove the outside doors, locks, roof, walls, or windows of the Premises except for purposes of
maintenance, repair, or replacement. Landlord cannot remove Tenant’s personal property from the Premises unless the
action is taken after surrender, abandonment, or a lawful eviction. If provided in a written agreement separate from the
Lease, upon surrender or abandonment by Tenant, Landlord shall not be liable or responsible for storage or disposition
of Tenant’s personal property. (For the purpose of this section, abandonment means Tenant is absent from the
Premises for at least one-half a Rental Installment Period without paying rent or giving Landlord reasonable notice of
Tenant’s absence).
XIII. CASUALTY DAMAGE. If the Premises are damaged or destroyed other than by wrongful or negligent acts of
Tenant or persons on the Premises with Tenant’s consent, so that the use of the Premises is substantially impaired. Tenant
may terminate the Lease within 30 days after the damage or destruction and Tenant will immediately vacate the premises. If
Tenant vacates, Tenant is not liable for rent that would have been due after the date of termination. Tenant may vacate the
part of the Premises rendered unusable by the damage or destruction, in which case Tenant’s liability for rent shall be
reduced by the fair rental value of the part of the Premises that was damaged or destroyed.
XIV. DEFAULT.
A. Landlord’s Default. Except as noted below, Landlord will be in default if Landlord fails to comply with Landlord’s
required maintenance obligations under Section IX(A) or fails to comply with other material provisions of the Lease
and such failure continues for more than 7 days after Tenant delivers a written notice to Landlord that tells Landlord
how Landlord has violated the Lease.
If Landlord’s failure to comply is due to causes beyond the Landlord’s control and if Landlord has made, and continues
to make, every reasonable effort to correct the problem, the Lease may be altered by the parties, as follows:
1. If Landlord’s failure to comply makes the Premises uninhabitable and Tenant vacates, Tenant shall not be liable
{219312.0001/M1805246_3}
for rent during the period the Premises remains uninhabitable.
2. If Landlord’s failure to comply does not make the Premises uninhabitable and Tenant continues to occupy the
Premises, the rent for the period of noncompliance will be reduced by an amount in proportion to the loss of rental
value caused by the noncompliance.
B. Tenant’s Default. Tenant will be in default if any of the following occur:
1. Tenant fails to pay rent when due and the default continues for 3 days, excluding Saturday, Sunday and legal
holidays, after delivery of written demand by Landlord for payment of the rent or possession of the Premises.
2. Tenant fails to perform its obligations under the Lease, and the failure is such that Tenant should not be given an
opportunity to correct it or the failure occurs within 12 months of a written warning by Landlord of a similar
failure. Examples of such failures which do not require an opportunity to correct include, but are not limited to,
destruction, damage, or misuse of Landlord’s or other Tenant’s property by an intentional act or a subsequent or
continued unreasonable disturbance.
3. Except as provided above, Tenant fails to perform any other obligation under the Lease and the default continues
for more than 7 days after deliver of written notice to Tenant from Landlord specifying the default.
C. Waiver of Default. If Landlord accepts rent knowing of Tenant’s default or accepts performance by Tenant of any
provision of the Lease different from the performance required by the Lease, if Tenant pays rent knowing of
Landlord’s default or accepts performance by Landlord of any provision of the Lease different from the performance
required by the Lease, the party accepting the rent or performance or making the payment shall not have the right to
terminate the Lease or to bring a lawsuit for that default, but may enforce any later default.
XV. REMEDIES AND DEFENSES.
A. Tenant’s Remedies.
1. If Landlord has defaulted under the Lease and if Tenant has given Landlord a written notice describing the default
and Tenant’s intention to withhold rent if the default is not corrected within 7 days, Tenant may withhold an
amount of rent equal to the loss in rental value caused by the default. If Tenant’s notice advises Landlord that
Tenant intends to terminate the Lease if the default is not cured within 7 days and the default is not cured within
the 7 days, Tenant may terminate the Lease.
2. If Tenant has given the notice referred to in subparagraph (1) above, and if Landlord has not corrected the default
within 7 days, Tenant may, in addition to withholding the applicable amount of rent, file a lawsuit in county court
to require Landlord to correct the default and for damages.
3. If Landlord’s default makes the Premises uninhabitable, and if Tenant has given Landlord a notice describing the
default and informing Landlord that Tenant intends to terminate the Lease, then if Landlord does not cure the
default within the 7-day period, Tenant may terminate the Lease at the end of the 7 days.
4. If Landlord violates the provisions of Section XII, Landlord shall be liable to Tenant for actual and consequential
damages or 3 months’ rent, whichever is greater, for each violation.
B. Landlord’s Remedies.
1. If Tenant remains on the Premises after expiration or termination of the Lease without Landlord’s permission,
Landlord may recover possession of the Premises in the manner provided for by law. Landlord may also recover
double rent for the period during which Tenant refuses to vacate the Premises.
2. If Tenant defaults under the Lease by failing to pay rent, as set forth in section XIV(B)(1), Landlord may
terminate Tenant’s rights under the Lease and Tenant shall vacate the Premises immediately. If Tenant defaults
under the Lease for any other reason, as set forth in sections XIC(B)(2) or (3) above, Landlord may terminate
Tenant’s rights under the Lease and Tenant shall vacate the Premises within 7 days of delivery of the notice of
termination.
3. If Tenant fails to cure a default within the time specified in the notice to Tenant, Landlord may recover possession
of the Premise as provided by law.
4. Landlord shall not recover possession of the Premises except:
a. in a lawsuit for possession;
b. when Tenant has surrendered possession of the Premises to Landlord; or
c. when Tenant has abandoned the Premises. Absent actual knowledge of abandonment, the Premises shall be
considered abandoned if Tenant is absent from them for at least one-half a Rental Installment Period, the rent
is not current, and Tenant has not notified Landlord, in writing, of an intended absence.
5. If Tenant has defaulted under the Lease and Landlord has obtained a writ of possession. If Tenant has surrendered
possession of the Premises to Landlord or if Tenant has abandoned the Premises, Landlord may:
a. treat the Lease as terminated, retake possession for Landlord’s own account, and any further liability of
Tenant will be ended;
b. retake possession of the Premises for Tenant’s account. Tenant will remain liable for the difference between
rent agreed to be paid under the Lease and rent Landlord is able to recover in good faith from a new tenant; or
{219312.0001/M1805246_3}
c. do nothing, and Tenant will be liable for the rent as it comes due.
6. If Landlord retakes possession of the Premises for Tenant’s account, Landlord must make a good faith effort to re-
lease the Premises. Any rent received by Landlord as a result of the new lease shall be deducted from the rent due
from Tenant. For purposes of this section, “good faith” in trying to re-lease the Premises means that Landlord
shall use at least the same efforts to re-lease the Premises as were used in the initial rental or at least the same
efforts as Landlord uses in attempting to lease other similar property. It does not require Landlord to give a
preference in leasing the Premises over other vacant properties that Landlord owns or has the responsibility to
rent.
C. Other Remedies Each party also may have other remedies available at law or in equity.
D. Defenses. In a lawsuit by Landlord for possession of the Premises based upon nonpayment of rent or in a lawsuit by
Landlord seeking to obtain unpaid rent, Tenant may assert as a defense Landlord’s failure to perform required
maintenance, as set forth in Section IX(A) above. Landlord’s failure to provide elective maintenance, as set forth in
Section IX(B) above, shall not be a defense to any lawsuit by Landlord for possession of the Premises unless otherwise
provided by the Lease or applicable law. Tenant also may raise any other defense, whether legal or equitable, that
Tenant may have, including the defense or retaliatory conduct.
E. Payment of Rent to Court. In any lawsuit by Landlord for possession of the Premises, if Tenant raises any defense
other than payment, Tenant must pay into the registry of the court the past due rent set forth in Landlord’s complaint,
or an amount determined by the court, and the rent which comes due during the lawsuit, as it comes due. Failure of
Tenant to pay the rent into the registry of the court will be a waiver of Tenant’s defenses other than payment.
F. Attorney’s Fees. In any lawsuit brought to enforce the Lease or under applicable law, the party who wins may recover
its reasonable court costs and attorneys’ fees from the party who loses.
XVII. RISK OF LOSS. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss by reason of damage, theft, or otherwise to the contents,
belongings, and personal effect of the Tenant, or Tenant’s family, agents, employees, guests, or visitors located in or
about the Premises, or for damage or injury to Tenant or Tenant’s family, agents, employees, guests, or visitors.
Landlord shall not be liable if such damage, theft or loss is caused by Tenant, Tenant’s family, agents, employees, guest
or visitors. Nothing contained in this provision shall relieve Landlord or Tenant from responsibility for loss, damage or
injury caused by its own negligence or willful conduct.
XVIII. SUBORDINATION. The Lease is subordinate to the lien of any mortgage encumbering the fee title to the Premises
from time to time.
XIX. LIENS. Tenant shall not have the right or authority to encumber the Premises or to permit any person to claim or assert
any lien for the improvement or repair of the Premises made by Tenant. Tenant shall notify all parties performing work
on the Premises at Tenant’s request that the Lease does not allow any liens to attach to Landlord’s interest.
XXI. RENEWAL/EXTENSION. The Lease can be renewed only by a written agreement signed by both Landlord and
Tenant, but no renewal may extend the term to a date more than 1 year after the lease begins. A new lease is
required each year.
