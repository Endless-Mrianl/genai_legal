E-RENTING PREMISES BY LANDLORD. In the event that Landlord secures a new tenant to
complete the term of this Rental Agreement or any part thereof, either because Tenant has so requested
or because Tenant is in default, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a re-renting fee equal to one month's rent
for expenses incurred by Landlord for re-renting Premises. New tenant shall be subject to Landlord's
reasonable approval and may be required by Landlord to be a student or a graduate student. Such
payments shall be in addition to other payments due or past due. If Tenant requests Landlord to secure
a new tenant for Premises, or if Tenant defaults on this Rental Agreement, Tenant understands that
Tenant remains liable for all responsibilities hereunder until such time said new tenancy commences. In
the event Tenant elects to request Landlord to find a new tenant to complete the term of this Rental
Agreement, the procedure, dates and details must be agreed upon by Landlord and by Tenant in writing
before Landlord will advertise or show Premises. In any circumstance, Landlord does not guarantee that
it can secure a new tenant and does not agree to give the Premises priority over other existing vacant
properties. In the event a new tenant is not secured to complete the term of this Rental Agreement,
Tenant will be entirely responsible for the Rental Agreement, including, but not limited to, all rent, utility,
reserved parking, furniture, and/or storage space fees, as well as expenses incurred by Landlord for
attempting to re-rent Premises, including, but not limited to advertising costs and time spent presenting
Premises to prospective new tenants.
