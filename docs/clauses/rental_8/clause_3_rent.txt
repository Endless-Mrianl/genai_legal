TILITIES AND SERVICES.
A. Tenant agrees to pay all costs, including all turn-on charges, directly to the utility company or
authority providing such service for the following utilities:
B. Landlord shall provide the following utilities and/or services, at Tenant’s expense:
For those utilities and/or services described in this subparagraph B, Tenant agrees to pay, in addition to
each rental payment, the total sum of $ , payable as follows:
$ due on or before ,
$ in monthly installments of $ each, beginning on and
$ due on or before , for the remaining portion due.
$ TOTAL
Trash removal is $9.00 per month per bedroom or per Tenant/Occupant, whichever is greater, and may
include recycling and composting. Internet costs are detailed in paragraph 29. If the actual utility or
service (electric, gas, water, sewer, trash removal, internet, or grounds maintenance) costs paid by
Landlord, for the entire rental term for Premises, exceeds the utility and service payments due from
Tenant by more than five percent (5%), Tenant agrees to pay Landlord the full difference. This shall be
determined by adding all utility & service costs and a $12.00 per month third-party provider administrative
and billing expense and then subtracting the utility payments made by Tenant as described above. If
water/sewer is on a central meter, the Tenant is charged a proportionate share of the costs based
on the number of persons sharing said meter. If electric or gas is on a central meter, the Tenant is
charged a proportionate share of the costs based on the number of bedrooms sharing said meter. Tenant
agrees that Landlord may elect to install a separate meter to measure Tenant’s usage of any shared
utility. By reasonable (not less than 30 days) notice, Landlord may adjust the monthly utility installments
paid by Tenant if Landlord’s costs exceed Tenant’s payments by more than ten percent (10%). Should
the utility and service payments received by Landlord exceed the actual utility costs, Tenant shall not be
entitled to any refund or rebate, so long as Landlord has established charges set forth above in good
faith.
C. For any utilities or services in either subparagraph A or B for which Tenant is responsible for
connecting, Tenant agrees to initiate service(s) on or before the commencement date of this Rental
Agreement and acknowledges that they may need to connect multiple meters for each service. Tenant is
responsible for contacting local utility companies to initiate services and authorizes Landlord to request
and obtain, on behalf of Tenant, Tenant’s consumption data from the applicable utility provider. Tenant
agrees to maintain those services throughout the term of this Rental Agreement to avoid damage to the
Premises and through 5 business days beyond the termination date of this Rental Agreement. In the
event Tenant fails to maintain utility services as described herein, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord any
costs associated with having any or all utilities connected plus an administrative fee of $40 for each utility
invoice received and paid by Landlord. If any utility (electric, gas, and/or water, sewer) is on a central
meter and/or if trash is collected at a central location, Landlord will pay for these utilities and services and
prorate the costs from the commencement date of this Rental Agreement to 5 business days beyond the
termination date of this Rental Agreement. Tenant will reimburse Landlord for the prorated amounts due
upon receipt of a statement from Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that some utility charges may be for
exterior or common areas adjacent to Premises.
D. Should Landlord pay Tenant’s delinquent water or sewer charges such amount paid shall become
additional rent due to Landlord. Tenant further agrees to pay Landlord a $100.00 administrative fee in
addition to any such charges paid by Landlord, also as additional rent.
