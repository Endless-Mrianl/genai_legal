IRE OR CASUALTY DAMAGE. If Premises is damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty to an
extent that Tenant’s enjoyment of Premises is substantially impaired or that required repairs can only be
accomplished if Tenant vacates Premises, either Tenant or Landlord may terminate this Rental
Agreement. Tenant may terminate this Rental Agreement by vacating Premises and within 14 days
thereafter, serving Landlord a written notice of his intention to terminate, in which case this Rental
Agreement will terminate as of the date of vacating. If continued occupancy is lawful there shall be a
reasonable rent reduction for such time until Premises is restored to the condition prior to fire or casualty;
and, in case of such deprivation of possession, Tenant shall be allowed a like reduction until possession
of Premises is restored to Tenant. Landlord may terminate this Rental Agreement by giving Tenant 30
days’ notice of intention to terminate based upon Landlord’s determination that such damage requires the
removal of Tenant and use of Premises is substantially impaired, in which case this Rental Agreement
will terminate as of the expiration of the notice period. If this Rental Agreement is terminated, Landlord
shall return all security deposits in accordance with paragraph 4 and 5 of this Rental Agreement and
prepaid rent, plus accrued interest recoverable by law, unless Landlord reasonably believes that Tenant,
or Tenant’s guests were the cause of the damage or casualty, in addition to paying for repair of all
damages and related costs, in which case Landlord shall account to Tenant for the security deposit and
prepaid rent, plus accrued interest based upon the damage or casualty. Accounting for rent in the event
of termination or apportionment shall be made as of the date of the casualty.
