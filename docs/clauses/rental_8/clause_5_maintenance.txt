ACATING; CLEANING CONVENIENCE FEE. Upon termination of the Rental Agreement, Tenant
shall vacuum carpets, sweep floors, wipe all surfaces clean, remove all trash and items of personal
property and promptly vacate, leaving the Premises in good order and repair.
For a fee of $ ,* Tenant hereby employs Landlord to perform the following services at the
termination of the lease term, to bring the Premises to move-in condition, normal wear and tear
excepted: Steam cleaning of carpeting; mopping of floors; touch-up painting; cleaning behind
appliances; cleaning of light fixtures and vents; final cleaning of all surfaces, including countertops,
shelving, appliances, restroom and kitchen fixtures, ceilings, doors, windows, blinds, walls, baseboards
and flooring; and cleaning of balconies and/or porches. Tenant authorizes the Cleaning Convenience
Fee to be deducted from the Deposit, and agrees to immediately pay such Fee to Landlord, should the
Deposit be insufficient to cover all sums owed to Landlord. In such event, any deficiency in the Cleaning
Convenience Fee shall be considered additional rent. The Cleaning Convenience Fee covers basic
cleaning, but not repairs, replacements of damaged items or painting beyond touch-ups. Should the
condition of the Premises be such that deeper or more intensive or extensive cleaning is required, in
Landlord’s sole discretion, Tenant agrees to pay such reasonable additional charges as may be required
to bring the Premises to move-in condition, normal wear and tear excepted. If repairs, replacements,
extra painting or additional cleaning beyond that covered by the Cleaning Convenience Fee is needed, in
Landlord’s sole discretion, and employees of Landlord perform such work, charges therefore shall be
$55 per hour for labor, plus the cost of materials, and overhead of 20% of labor and materials. A
minimum charge of one hour for labor shall be assessed on all repairs. If Landlord employs a
subcontractor to do such work, the work will be charged at the amount invoiced, plus 20% overhead. No
right of storage beyond the end of the lease term is given by this Rental Agreement. In the event
Tenant’s personal property is not removed from the Premises at the termination of this Rental
Agreement, Landlord may consider such property abandoned and may dispose of it without liability for
damage or loss, in accordance with applicable Virginia law. In such event, Tenant shall pay Landlord’s
reasonable costs of removal and/or disposal of such property. In the event Landlord elects to store
Tenant’s property, Tenant shall pay for all costs of removal and storage. Tenant agrees to leave all
utilities that are in Tenant’s name connected from the commencement day of this Rental Agreement until
