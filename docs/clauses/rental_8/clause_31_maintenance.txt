ON-LIABILITY OF LANDLORD. Landlord shall not be liable for any injury or damage to persons
or property either caused by or resulting from falling plaster or drywall, dampness, overflow or leakage
upon or into the Premises of water, rain, snow, ice, sewage, steam, gas, or electricity, or by any
breakage in or malfunction of electronically locking doors, video cameras, pipes, plumbing fixtures, sump
pumps, air conditioners, or appliances, or leakage, breakage, or obstruction of soil pipes, nor for any
injury or damage from any other cause unless any such injury or damage is the result of willful
misconduct or gross negligence of Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that basement rooms are not
considered watertight and may, on occasion, take on water. Tenant shall give prompt notice to Landlord
of any of the foregoing occurrences, however caused. In addition, Landlord is not responsible for theft of
Tenant’s personal property or any other criminal acts by known or unknown third parties on or near
Premises. It shall be the responsibility of Tenant to obtain insurance to cover loss or damage to personal
property. A breach by any other tenant of any term of that tenant’s rental agreement shall not constitute a
breach by Landlord of any obligation to Tenant hereunder. Tenant hereby releases Landlord from any
liability resulting from the acts of third persons who are not agents of Woodard Properties, or from other
tenants. There shall be no rent reductions, compensation to Tenant, or cause for termination of this
Rental Agreement because of interruptions of any utilities or services or the failure of any appliance to
function properly or because of any inconvenience arising from such interruption or failure to function
properly where Landlord has been notified of any such interruption, malfunction, or failure of the above
services by Tenant and has made reasonable efforts to repair.
