ENEWAL. This Rental Agreement will not automatically renew. However, a new rental agreement
for an additional term may be executed subject to the availability of Premises, Landlord’s approval, and
revised terms and conditions. In the event a new rental agreement is executed and one or more persons
listed as Tenant signs a new rental agreement for Premises, a Renewal Rental Addendum is to be
agreed upon and signed by all current persons listed as Tenant and all future tenants. The entire security
deposit will transfer to the new agreement and Landlord will not inspect or prepare the Premises
between the current Tenant and future tenants’ occupancy.
