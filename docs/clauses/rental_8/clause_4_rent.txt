ECURITY DEPOSIT. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord the following:
$ Security Deposit payment upon execution of this Rental Agreement.
$ Balance of Security Deposit due prior to the commencement of this rental term.
The Security Deposit, hereinafter “Deposit”, may be applied solely by Landlord to the payment of
accrued rent, to charges for late payments of rent as specified herein, to the payment of any damages
which Landlord suffers by reason of Tenant’s non-compliance with his duty to maintain Premises, and to
any other damages as provided herein. Nothing in this section, however, entitles Tenant to an immediate
credit against any delinquent rent. Acceptance of the Deposit by Landlord does not constitute any waiver
of damages that may exceed the amount of the Deposit or any waiver of any other rights Landlord may
have against Tenant by reason of Tenant’s default. In the event damages suffered by Landlord by
reason of Tenant’s default exceed the amount of the Deposit, Landlord shall be entitled to recover such
damages from Tenant, along with the costs of exercising these rights. If Tenant complies with all
provisions of this Rental Agreement, the Deposit, or the balance thereof, shall be returned within 45 days
after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession or within such longer period as permitted by
Virginia Law. Landlord will issue one check made payable to the Contact Person named in paragraph 10
of this Rental Agreement, and will mail the Deposit statement and refund, if applicable, to one address
supplied by Tenant at termination of this Rental Agreement. In the event it becomes necessary for
Landlord to replace the Deposit refund check, any stop payment cost incurred by Landlord and/or a $50
administrative fee will be deducted from the refund.
