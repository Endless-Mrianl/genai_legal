Landlord by 5:00 PM on the 5 day of each month, Tenant agrees to pay a late fee of 10% of the
monthly rental. Tenant agrees to pay an additional $5.00 each day of delay beyond the 6 of each
month until the day the amount is paid in full. Tenant agrees not to submit post-dated checks for
payments due. Without prior agreement with Landlord, any check received by Landlord will be promptly

handling fee of $50.00 or the maximum allowed by law, in addition to interest, as allowed by law. Tenant

fees in addition to amount of returned payment. Landlord reserves the right to require a cashier’s check
or money order in payment of rent. Cash is not accepted for any payment.
