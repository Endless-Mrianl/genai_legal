EFAULT.
(a) NON-PAYMENT. If rent or any payment required to be made under this Rental Agreement is unpaid
when due, and Tenant fails to make such payment or to pay such rent within five days after written notice
is served on Tenant notifying Tenant of the non-payment and of Landlord's intention to terminate this
Rental Agreement if the rent or other payment is not paid within the five day period, Landlord may
terminate this Rental Agreement and proceed to obtain possession of Premises as provided by law. In
the event the rental payment is not received by the 11 day of the month and Landlord files a warrant or
summons for collection, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a processing fee of $75.00, in addition to any
other amounts owed under this Rental Agreement.
(b) MATERIAL NON-COMPLIANCE. Except as otherwise provided by law, if there is a material non-
compliance by Tenant with any term of this Rental Agreement, Landlord may serve a written notice
on Tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that if after receipt of
the notice the breach is not remedied within twenty-one days, this Rental Agreement shall terminate as
provided in the notice. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise
and Tenant adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, this Rental
Agreement shall not terminate. If the breach is one by its nature not remediable, for example, a breach
of Tenant’s duty to refrain from disturbing his neighbors, sub-leasing without written permission from
Landlord or Tenant’s smoking in Premises, this Rental Agreement shall terminate upon the date
specified in the notice. Tenant agrees they are in default of this Rental Agreement if Tenant or any
Occupant violates fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or
conviction occurs. Tenant agrees that any violation of paragraphs 13 or 14 shall be considered a material
violation of this agreement.

(c) REPRESENTATIONS IN RENTAL APPLICATION. This Rental Agreement was entered into based
upon the representations of Tenant contained in the Rental Application(s). If any of those
representations are found to be misleading, incorrect or untrue, or change (including but not limited to
scholastic, employment, or criminal history), Landlord may immediately terminate this Rental Agreement
and notify Tenant to vacate the Premises.
(d) VIOLATION OF PARAGRAPH 13 OR 14 AFFECTING HEALTH AND SAFETY. If Tenant violates
paragraph 13 or 14 of this Rental Agreement or any other provision of this Rental Agreement materially
affecting health and safety and the violation can be remedied by repair, replacement of a damaged item
or cleaning, and Tenant fails to comply as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency or within
twenty-one days of written notice by Landlord specifying the breach and requesting that Tenant remedy it
within that period of time, Landlord may enter Premises and cause the work to be done in a workman-
like manner and submit an itemized bill for actual and reasonable cost or the fair and reasonable value
thereof as rent due on the next date when periodic rent is due, or if this Rental Agreement has
terminated, due immediately.
(e) NON-WAIVER. Acceptance of periodic or partial rent payments with knowledge of a default by
Tenant or acceptance of performance by Tenant that varies from the terms of this Rental Agreement or
rules or regulations subsequently adopted by Landlord shall not constitute waiver of Landlord’s rights
after the breach has occurred.
(f) LANDLORD’S REMEDIES AFTER TERMINATION. If this Rental Agreement is terminated by
Landlord, Landlord shall have a claim for possession and for rent and a separate claim for actual
damages for breach of this Rental Agreement and reasonable attorney’s fees as provided by law. Actual
damages for breach of the Rental Agreement shall include a claim for such rent as would have accrued
until the expiration of the term of this Rental Agreement or until a tenancy pursuant to a new rental
agreement commences; whichever first occurs. Actual damages also include collection costs of any kind
incurred by Landlord to collect amounts owed by Tenant, and interest at 18% on the unpaid balance until
paid in full.
(g) FAILURE TO VACATE AT END OF RENTAL AGREEMENT. If Tenant fails to vacate Premises, or
deliver possession of entire Premises, on or before the termination date and time of this Rental
Agreement, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord 150% of the daily prorated rent, as liquidated damages, for
each day or portion of day.
(h) LANDLORD’S REMEDIES IN GENERAL. The Landlord may recover damages and obtain
injunctive relief for any non-compliance by the Tenant with this Rental Agreement. The Landlord shall
be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees as provided in the Virginia Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act.
(i) E-MAIL NOTICE. A notice given to Tenant by Landlord through a Tenant-provided E-mail address
shall constitute proper notice.
