our cover.
Cover if your pet needs medical treatment.
Unfortunately, your pet may fall ill or be injured and need treatment by a medical professional. This part of our cover helps you to pay
for such bills.
Important things you should be aware of
Pre-Existing conditions (anything your pet has had any treatment, medication or advice for in the last 24 months) are a common cause of claims
being turned down in this section. You can always call us if you are not sure about this definition.
You must ensure that your pet has its annual check-up, a dental check-up every 12 months, and vaccinations so they remain healthy. If you donâ€™t,
then claims might be rejected.
