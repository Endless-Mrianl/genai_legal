acceleration of the Loan or Mortgage Loan, then County may, after delivery of notice to
Borrower and the expiration of any applicable cure periods, apply the funds in the
Operating Reserve Account to the Loan, a Mortgage Loan, or use such funds for the
continued operation of the Project.

gently cure for thirty (30) days after notice thereof in writing is given by the County to

obligation to make or continue the Loan and shall give the County the right to proceed
with any and all remedies set forth in this Agreement and the Loan Documents or
otherwise available at law or in equity or by statute (and all of the County's rights and
remedies shall be cumulative), including but not limited to the following:
(a) Acceleration of Note. The County shall have the right to cause all
indebtedness of the Borrower to the County under this Agreement and the Note, together
with any accrued interest thereon, to become immediately due and payable. The
Borrower waives all right to presentment, demand, protest or notice of protest, or
dishonor. The County may proceed to enforce payment of the indebtedness and to
exercise any or all rights afforded to the County as a creditor and secured party under the
law including the Uniform Commercial Code, including foreclosure under the Deed of
Trust. The Borrower shall be liable to pay the County on demand all expenses, costs and
fees (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the
County in connection with the collection of the Loan and the preservation, maintenance,
protection, sale, or other disposition of the security given for the Loan.
(b) Specific Performance. The County shall have the right to mandamus or
other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity to require Borrower to perform its
obligations and covenants under the Loan Documents or to enjoin acts on things that may
be unlawful or in violation of the provisions of the Loan Documents.
(c) Right to Cure at Borrower's Expense. The County shall have the right to
cure any monetary default by Borrower under a loan other than the Loan. The Borrower
agrees to reimburse the County for any funds advanced by the County to cure a monetary
default by Borrower upon demand therefore, together with interest thereon at the rate of
twelve percent (12%) per annum (which rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate
permitted by law and if it does, said rate shall be reduced to the maximum rate then
permitted by law), from the date of expenditure until the date of reimbursement.
8.3 Remedies Cumulative. No right, power, or remedy given to the County by
the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents is intended to be exclusive of any
other right, power, or remedy; and each and every such right, power, or remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right, power, or remedy given to the County by
the terms of any such instrument, or by any statute or otherwise against Borrower and any
other person. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of the County to exercise any
such rights and remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by the County of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
of such right or remedy, or any other right or remedy.
8.4 Waiver of Terms and Conditions. No waiver of any default or breach by
Borrower hereunder shall be implied from any omission by the County to take action on
account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall
affect any default other than the default specified in the waiver, and such waiver shall be
operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant,
term, or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
[ ] – County Loan Agreement 30
2023 Supportive Housing NOFA Amendment

March 2024
ATTACHMENT N 1
breach of the same covenant, term, or condition. The consent or approval by the County
to or of any act by Borrower requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to
waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar act.
The exercise of any right, power, or remedy shall in no event constitute a cure or a waiver
of any default under this Agreement or the Loan Documents, nor shall it invalidate any
act done pursuant to notice of default, or prejudice the County in the exercise of any
right, power, or remedy hereunder or under the Loan Documents, unless in the exercise
of any such right, power, or remedy all obligations of Borrower to County are paid and
discharged in full.
